# computer-science-assignment-code
this code contains the code of the paper assignment for the course FEM21037 in year 2023 first the data is preprocessed, such that the title and selected features are joined as combination then apply shingling into the combination vectors, hashed into characteristic matrix use the characteristic matrix as input of Min-hashing and the signature matrix as output LSH applieda afterwards using banding techniques, parameter b and r are of choice as the second part of the algorithm, hierarchical agglomerative clustering is appied, by comparing the cosine similarity matrix from the TF-IDF matrix.

part of the code was shared to Livia Neven(503531), as programming buddy.
